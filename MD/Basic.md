# Basic Simulations

In these first tutorials, we will go through the basics of setting up and running simulations in MGDrivE.


## Mendelian Inheritance

Our first cases will involve running MGDrivE on Mendelian inheritance baselines with, and without fitness costs on specific allelic combinations.

After running our deterministic simulations, we can have a go at running a stochastic one:

## Wolbachia

Finally, we will simulate incompatible-insect-techique (IIT) releases for population suppression (an example being [Beebe et al. 2021](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2106828118)):
